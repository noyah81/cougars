| Calvin Github User : statsprojectlol | Wenshi Github User : |
| Megan  Github User : MeganCorrigan |  | 
| Noya Github User : noyah81| 


### Assignments

Noya :

Group Accomplishents (Week of 1/11)
Established nav bar
Routes fixed

### How to run: 
-Running through IntelliJ, click on link to website

-The link takes the user to the home page where the site is introduced. 

-Up top there is a nav where with interest points linked

-When the user clicks on the interest point they want, the website leads to a page with information on each of the interest points

-On each infromation page there is a picture of the site, a button linking to directions to the location, and a short description of the site

### About the code:
-empire.html, time.html, liberty.html, madisonsqaure.html, museum.html, statue.html: establish the informational pages

   -bootstrap for Jumbotron photos centered 
   
   -bootstrap for button linking to directions
   
-home.html: runs the main page ("welcome" page for users upon clicking link)

   -form for users (Bootstrao) to input emails and sites they visited
   
-base.html: established navigation bar

   -dropdown menu coded here for stations
   
-main.py: establishes routes

   -takes user to the page they want to access (html pages under "templates") from navigation bar

### **College Board Requirements**


####CB Big Idea #1 Creative Development:

Work on a database where you can insert an input and get an output. For this group specifically, we are aiming to create a query that allows people in New York to get information on the subways. 

####CB Big Idea #2 Data: 

To get the data we need for this webapp, we will need to first get points of intrest in New York that can be reached through a subway. Then we will use a New York subway database to get variables such as departure and arrival times so that the user can reach the point of interest at given time. This allows for the user to plan out their day easier

####CB Big Idea #3 Algorithms and Programming:
 
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, an appealing website will be made. This will attract clients to want to come to our website and explore it a bit. Using what we learned last trimester, we will be able to apply that to our new website.

####CB Big Idea #4 Computer Systems and Networks:
Using a Raspberry Pi, this group will create a server to run the website, then use HTTP to allow for someone to request data.

####CB Big Idea #5 Impact of Computing:

Some impacts our project will have on society is knowledge on transportation, especially to those foreign on the use of subways. Travelers will be able to look up times and plan their trips. An impact on the locals is that it helps them plan for attending important events and jobs.
